Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a college student majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Welcome to my GitHub account!

About Me
I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve lives. My interests include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. I'm also interested in exploring the ethical implications of AI and how we can ensure that AI is developed and used responsibly.

What you'll find here
On my GitHub account, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on as part of my studies, as well as personal projects I've undertaken to explore topics that interest me. Some of the topics I've explored include:

Image classification using convolutional neural networks
Text classification using natural language processing techniques
Generative models, such as GANs
Reinforcement learning
How to get in touch
If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to chat about AI and data science, feel free to reach out to me! You can find my contact information on my personal website, which is linked in my GitHub profile.
